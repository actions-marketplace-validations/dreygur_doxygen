# Doxygen as Action

This [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) will build [doxygen](http://doxygen.nl/) docs from the specified doxyfile.

Use with an action such as [actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) to deploy to your project's GitHub pages site!

**NOTE:** If you are using dot/graphviz in your doxygen config to generate diagrams the only fonts installed, and hence can be used are those in the [GNU FreeFont](https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/) package (FreeSans, FreeMono and FreeSerif) or in any package listed in `additional-packages`.

## Inputs

#### `working-directory`

**Optional** Path of the working directory to change to before running doxygen. Default: `.`

#### `doxyfile-path`

**Optional** Path of the Doxyfile relative to the working directory. Default: `./Doxyfile`.

#### `enable-latex`

**Optional** Flag to enable `make`-ing of the LaTeX part of the doxygen output. Default: `false`.

#### `additional-packages`

**Optional** Additional [Alpine packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages) to install in the environment (i.e. font packages)
